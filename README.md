Remote control for automatic crane system

Hello guys, this is a first experiment to implement a remote controller for big automatic cranes used in industrial applications using
a rugged tablet running Android

The communication is made via WiFi and the industrial control is an OMRON PLC (CJ2 series) with integrated Ethernet TCP/IP port.
